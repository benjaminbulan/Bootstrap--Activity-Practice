  <B><li>UX Design</li><br></B>
  <p>This course introduces students to the Human-Centered Design (HCD) process through a collaboration between KodeGo and UX Philippines. It aims to equip students with the necessary skills in fulfilling the role of a generalist UX designer or a product designer in industry or academia. The course combines theories, principles delivered in a studio-style approach where they get to work collaboratively towards a design product and a personal portfolio. The course is organized into core modules that slowly shifts the focus of the student starting from the individual, to collaborator teams all the way to leadership. This process is spiral and iterative where they learn the basics and specialize in terms of scale and impact. In this process, they refine their skills as they learn to craft their work and involve more or different stakeholders.</p>
  <strong>Skills to Achieve:<p></strong>Wireframing and Prototyping, Figma</p>
